# CTFUseIt-HackEPS
Police have found a dead person in the middle of the main square. The police detected via DNA test that the deceased person is named Juan Martín de Gales. He was a computer engineer who graduated from the "Universitat de Lleida." As the police do not have enough computer scientists, they are asking for some help. The police suspect that the perpetrator is a computer scientist as well because he left a link to a website with a treasure hunt to obtain his identification. He clearly wants to play with the police. Firstly, police wants to test you with a fun exam to make sure you accomplish the level. (Easy Test).
